## Before this Module

In the previous module ([behavior-strategy-implementation](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/behavior-strategy-implementation), 3 weeks) students learned how to approach coding challenges, first by analyzing other people's solutions then by applying a structured approach to writing their own solutions.

They had one group project that used `import`/`export` and linting+formatting+tests+documentation to prepare then for the projects in this module.

## After this Module

In the next module ([state](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/state), 2 weeks) students will learn how to think about applications as data-first, designing a quiz app around a JS object containing quiz state and an array of questions. Along the way they will learn about rendering data into DOM components, and to use a store for accessing state.

The project is a two-week group project where students are given a backlog of user stories and the program data. The rest is up to them.
