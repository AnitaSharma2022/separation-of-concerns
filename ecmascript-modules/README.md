# ECMAScript Modules

> This folder covers many different ways to use modules, much more than you need to know for now.
>
> All you _need to know_ for this module is `export const something = ...` and `import { something } from '../path'`.

These examples are adapted from [javascript.info/modules-intro](https://javascript.info/modules-intro) and [javascript.info/import-export](https://javascript.info/import-export)

You can step through these examples in two ways:

- **Browser**: Open the `index.html` files using a static server such as `liveServer` or `study`
- **VSCode**: run the `index.js` files using the built-in debugger
